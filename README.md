# My Emacs settings

This is an ever-changing set of Emacs settings. These are more or less grouped in files:

- `init.el`: top-level file, containing mostly everything

- `setup-*.el`: if the configuration of a package takes more than a few lines, it is put in a
  dedicated file.
  
- `host-*.el`: host-specific settings
